# Semantic-Segmentation
This repository is made to solve the semantic segmentation challenge on the pascal voc database.
We made two different approaches to solve this problem:  
* A non neural network related method - src/RAG_thresholding
* A deep learning method based on deeplab of tensorflow model codes - src/deeplab

Theres a readme mentioning the requirements and the step by step to run each one of them inside each one's folder.
